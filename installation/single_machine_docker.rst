This section describes setting up a Citus cluster on a single machine using docker-compose.

**1. Install docker and docker-compose**

* Install the `Docker Platform <https://www.docker.com/products/overview#/install_the_platform>`_.
* On most platforms this will install docker-compose as well, but on Linux you'll need to install docker-compose manually by downloading the binary and putting it in your path:

  .. code-block:: bash

    curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.11.1/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

**2. Start the Citus Cluster**

Citus uses docker-compose to run and connect containers holding the database master node, workers, and a persistent data volume. To create a local cluster download our docker-compose configuration file and run it

.. code-block:: bash

  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citusdata/docker/master/docker-compose.yml
  docker-compose -p citus up -d

The first time you start the cluster it builds its containers. Subsequent startups take a matter of seconds.

.. note::

  If you have PostgreSQL running on your machine you may encounter this error when starting the Docker containers:

  .. code::

    Error starting userland proxy:
    Bind for 0.0.0.0:5432: unexpected error address already in use

  This is because the "master" service attempts to bind to the standard PostgreSQL port 5432. Simply adjust :code:`docker-compose.yml`. Under the :code:`master` section change the host port from 5432 to 5433 or another non-conflicting number.

  .. code-block:: diff

    - ports: ['5432:5432']
    + ports: ['5433:5432']

**3. Verify that installation has succeeded**


To verify that the installation has succeeded we check that the master node has picked up the desired worker configuration. First start the psql shell on the master node:

.. code-block:: bash

  docker exec -it citus_master psql -U postgres

Then run this query:

.. code-block:: bash

  select * from master_get_active_worker_nodes();

You should see a row for each worker node including the node name and port.

**4. Shut down the cluster when ready**

When you wish to stop the docker containers, use docker-compose:

.. code-block:: bash

  docker-compose -p citus down
